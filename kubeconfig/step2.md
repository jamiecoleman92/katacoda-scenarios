## Making requests to the microservices

Issue the following command to check the status of your microservices:

`kubectl get --watch pods`{{execute}}

If you see 0/1 beside the status **not ready**, wait a little while and check again. This will change to 1/1 and **Running** when your microservices are ready to receive requests.

Now your microservices are deployed and running with the **Ready** status you are ready to send some requests. Press `ctrl-c` to exit the terminal command.

Firstly check the IP address of your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

`minikube ip`{{execute}}

Now you need to set the environment variable `IP` to the IP address of your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

`IP=$(minikube ip)`{{execute}}

Next, you'll use `curl` to make an `HTTP GET` request to the 'system' service. The service is secured with a user id and password that is passed in the request.

`curl -u bob:bobpwd http://$IP:31000/system/properties`{{execute}}

You should see a response that will show you the JVM system properties of the running container.


Similarly, use the following `curl` command to call the inventory service:  

`curl http://$IP:32000/inventory/systems/system-service`{{execute}}

The inventory service will call the system service and store the response data in the inventory service before returning the result.

In this tutorial, you're going to use a Kubernetes ConfigMap to modify the `X-App-Name:` response header. Take a look at their current values by running the following curl command:

`curl -u bob:bobpwd -D - http://$IP:31000/system/properties -o /dev/null`{{execute}}
